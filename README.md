# Markdown Previewer

A React.js app that takes given Markdown syntax and outputs a preview that updates as you type.

Inspired by the [Build a Markdown Previewer challenge](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) as part of the curriculum for the [Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
